## Step 1

Create an HTML5 page with a `header`, `footer` and `main` section in `index.html`. The main section should contain a content section and a sidebar. Make the sidebar align to the right side of the content section.

`index.html` should include:

- `test.css`
- `test.js`
- `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js`

The header should include a nav with three links:

- Home - index.html
- About - /about
- Blog - /blog


## Step 2

In the content section of the site, build out a simple blog post that has a featured image. Feel free to pull in some alternative placeholders with something like [Zombie Ipsum](http://www.zombieipsum.com/) or [Cincy Ipsum](http://www.cincyipsum.com/) for text and [Fill Murray](http://www.fillmurray.com/) or [Place Kitten](http://placekitten.com/) for the image. Design this however you would like, we want to see your style shine through.


## Step 3

Using CSS, make `index.html` responsive. Style from mobile through desktop views.


## Bonus

- Write your styles in SCSS, SASS, or LESS
- For using BEM methodology
